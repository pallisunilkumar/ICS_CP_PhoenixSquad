Here are user instructions for the provided code:

1. Run the program and input a number from 1 to 9 to choose a geometric shape or object.
2. For each shape, follow the prompts to input the required dimensions (e.g., radius, side lengths, etc.).
3. The program will then calculate and display the area of the chosen shape.
4. If you enter a number outside the range 1-9, the program will display "No input."

Example:

If you enter '1,' the program will prompt you to enter the radius of a circle and then display the calculated area.
If you enter '5,' the program will prompt you to enter the side length of an equilateral triangle and then display the calculated area.
